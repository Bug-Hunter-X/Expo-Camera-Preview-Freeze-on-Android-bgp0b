This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with certain devices and Android versions. The camera preview might freeze or become unresponsive, leading to a poor user experience.  The error isn't always accompanied by a clear error message in the console, making debugging difficult. This issue is intermittent and not consistently reproducible across different devices or versions, which adds to the challenge.
