# Expo Camera Preview Freeze on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API on certain Android devices. The camera preview intermittently freezes, leading to an unresponsive camera. The issue is challenging to debug due to its inconsistent nature and the lack of a clear error message.

## Bug Description

The camera preview freezes unexpectedly. This occurs on some Android devices, but not all. There's no consistent error message in the console logs, making it hard to pinpoint the root cause.

## Solution

The solution involves adding error handling and implementing a mechanism to restart the camera preview if it freezes. The improved code includes retry logic to resume the preview after a specified delay.
